# Daily-Planner

## Description

Our requirement for this assignment was to create a daily planner.
Using method.js, it allowed us to keep track of time, so the current date can be accessed at the top as well as keeping track of the current hour. For hours that have yet to come, the text-box would be green, when in the current hour, the color is green, and for past hours, the color of the text box is gray. When something is typed in the text box saved, whatever was typed will be saved in local storage.

## Usage

To utilize your planner, make sure you type whatever you need to remember and don't forget to hit save!
